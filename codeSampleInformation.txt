Hello,

You can view some of my person code samples on my GitHub, although they vary in nature.

https://github.com/Zhious

If you would like me to make a specific code sample for you I'd be happy to look at it, 
simply email me a request at aaronstarrdev@gmail.com

My current work at Syracuse University is closed-sourced and does not allow me to share samples.

Thanks,
Aaron Starr
